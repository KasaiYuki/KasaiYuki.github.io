## Kinematics

    - Vector: a quantity that has both magnitude(amount) and direction. Ex: 35 miles(magnitude) west(direction)
    - Scalar: a quantity that has only magnitude. Ex: 25 mph.
    - Distance vs. Displacement 
        - Distance (scalar) is how far something moves and it includes the path travelled. Ex: 3 meters
            - Distance can NOT be negative, no matter where the object goes. This is because distance, being a scalar has no directional value
        - Displacement (vector) is the straight-line distance from where the object started to where it ended. Ex: 2 Meters 36 degrees
            - Displacement is the change in position of an object. Δx = xf − xi
            - Displacement, being a vector, can be negative. Ex: going backwards.
