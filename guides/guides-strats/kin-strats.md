## Word Problems
1. The key method to remember is to list what you know, want to know, and don’t know(include signs). For example: if you know a, t, x, v0, want to know x0 and don’t know v, match it to an equation. You would need an equation that doesn’t have v, but has everything else, including x0. This would match up to equation 2 and solve for x0.
2. The next step is to plug in and solve for what you want.
3. Deciphering the word problem is different for each question, but there are a few hints. 
    1. Use the units given to quickly find out what it position, velocity, and acceleration. Ex: m/s2 is acceleration, while m/s is velocity
    2. Keep in mind the direction for all values
    3. Quickly sketch a graph to visualize the data, or just try to visualize the object in your mind if it is something easy. Ex: a car or human
4. Piecewise: piecewise functions are basically 2 or more lines combined. Split the lines up and solve them separately. Make separate lists, and you may have to use different equations
