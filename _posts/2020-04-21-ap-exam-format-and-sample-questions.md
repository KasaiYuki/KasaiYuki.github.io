### Are you ready!

With the exam closing in, I wanted to make this post to just remind everyone about the format of the exam this year.
So there are Two FRQs:
* Q1 - Qualitative/Quantitative Translation (QQT) - will be 25 minutes and is 60% of your score
* Q2 - Paragraph Argument Short Answer - will be 15 mins and is 40% of your score

Also, here is a link for sample questions I found in case you haven't seen it: [Sample Questions](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-2020exam-sample-questions-physics-1.pdf)
